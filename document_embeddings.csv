In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven FIFA World Rankings|highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil national football team|Brazil in the seeded pot. As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations. The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Sauipe|Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players. Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.

===Squads===


As with the 2010 FIFA World Cup squads|2010 tournament, each team's squad consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers). Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than 10 days before the start of the tournament. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.<ref name=""regulations""/> During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team were available to be one of the three permitted substitutions (provided the player was not serving a suspension).<ref name=""regulations""/>

==Venues==


12 venues (seven new and five renovated) in twelve cities were selected for the tournament. The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 finals in Brazil. Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams. During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 2014 FIFA World Cup venues#Team base camps|32 separate base camps, as well as staging FIFA Fan Fest#2014|official fan fests where supporters could view the games.

The most used stadiums were the Maracanã and Brasilia, which hosted seven matches each. The least-used venues were in Cuiabá, Manaus, Natal, and Curitiba, which hosted four matches each; as the four smallest stadiums in use at the tournament, they did not host any knockout round matches.<ref name=""fifa_venues""/>

For a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA staged FIFA Fan Fests in each of the 12 host cities throughout the competition. Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú. The first official event took place on Praia de Iracema|Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.

In order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at, among other competitions, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013 Confederations Cup. The chosen GoalControl|Goal Control system featured 14 high speed cameras, 7 directed to each of the goals. Data were sent to the central image-processing centre, where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal. The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal. France's second goal in their 2014 FIFA World Cup Group E#France vs Honduras|group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given.

Following successful trials, FIFA approved the use of vanishing spray by the referees for the first time at a World Cup Finals. The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a Direct free kick|free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.

The Adidas Brazuca was the official Football (association football)|match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.<ref name=""forbes""/> Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the 2010 FIFA World Cup|previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.

===Cooling breaks===
Due to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced. Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded ; the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.

The first cooling break in a World Cup play took place during the 32nd minute of the 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Netherlands vs Mexico|match between the Netherlands and Mexico in the round of 16. At the start of the match, FIFA listed the temperature at  with 68% humidity.

===Anti-doping===
The biological passport was introduced in the FIFA World Cup starting in 2014. Blood and urine samples collected from all players before the competition, and from two players per team per match, were analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses. FIFA reported that 91.5% of the players taking part in the tournament were tested before the start of the competition and none tested positive. However, FIFA was criticised for how it conducted doping tests.

2014 FIFA World Cup,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup,"The first round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four, where each group engaged in a round-robin tournament within itself.

# Goal difference in matches between tied teams
# Number of goals scored in matches between tied teams
# Drawing of lots

In the single-elimination tournament|knockout stage there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. The two semi-final losers competed in a third place play-off. For any match in the knockout stage, a draw after 90 minutes of regulation time was followed by two 15 minute periods of Overtime (association football)|extra time to determine a winner. If the teams were still tied, a Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out was held to determine a winner.<ref name=""regulations""/>

The match schedule was announced on 20 October 2011 with the kick-off times being confirmed on 27 September 2012; after the final draw, the kick-off times of seven matches were adjusted by FIFA. The competition was organised so that teams that played each other in the group stage could not meet again during the knockout phase until the final (or the 3rd place match).<ref name=""regulations""/>
The group stage began on 12 June, with the host nation competing in the opening game as has been the format since the 2006 tournament. The opening game was preceded by an 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony|opening ceremony that began at 15:15 local time.

On 12 June 2014, the 20th edition of the FIFA World Cup began with the opening ceremony at Arena Corinthians|Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. The event saw 660 dancers take to the stadium and perform in a ceremony which celebrated the nature of the country and its love of football. Following the dancers native singer Claudia Leitte emerged on centre stage to perform for the crowd. She was later joined by Cuban-American rapper Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull, and American singer Jennifer Lopez to perform the tournament's official song ""We Are One (Ole Ola)"" which had been released as an official single on 8 April 2014. Following the ceremony, the opening match was played, which saw the hosts come from behind to beat Croatia 3–1.

2014 FIFA World Cup,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup,"The group stage of the cup took place in Brazil from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each team played three games. The group stage was notable for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals. The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930. The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament. This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998 and the largest average in a group stage since 1958. World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 tournament. Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002. For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 tournament.

===Third place play-off===
The Netherlands defeated Brazil 3–0 to secure third place, the first for the Dutch team in their history. Overall, Brazil conceded 14 goals in the tournament; this was the most by a team at any single World Cup since 1986, and the most by a host nation in history, although their fourth-place finish still represented Brazil's best result in a World Cup since their last win in 2002.



===Final===

The final featured Germany against Argentina for a record third time after 1986 FIFA World Cup final|1986 and 1990 FIFA World Cup final|1990.

===Head injuries===
During the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious. The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.

Second, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.

Sergio Agüero, Dirk Kuyt and Maxi Rodríguez all scored their penalties, giving Argentina a 4–2 shoot-out win. The press in Argentina called Romero's two saves the ""hands of God"", a reference to the The hand of God|""hand of God"" goal scored by Diego Maradona in 1986. Argentina progressed to their fifth final, which was also their first since 1990.<ref name=""Britanica""/>

A performance of two acts, the ceremony lasted about 20 minutes. The first act featured 22 samba dancers and a host of other performers, 32 of the dancers wearing dresses decorated in the colours of each of the participating teams. The second act featured musical performances headlined by Colombian singer Shakira, and included singers Carlinhos Brown, Wyclef Jean, Alexandre Pires and Ivete Sangalo as well as guitarist Carlos Santana. Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen and Carles Puyol, a member of Spain's winning team in 2010, unveiled the FIFA World Cup Trophy.

Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was present at the final, along with Russian president Vladimir Putin, whose country hosted 2018 FIFA World Cup|the next World Cup, and Jacob Zuma, the President of South Africa, the previous hosts. Representing the finalists, German president Joachim Gauck and chancellor Angela Merkel were in attendance, although Argentina's president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner could not attend because of both her grandson's birthday and a case of pharyngo-laryngitis. Other world leaders present included Viktor Orbán of Hungary, Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon and Antigua and Barbuda's Gaston Browne. Several celebrities and athletes also attended the final, including Rihanna, Daniel Craig, Mick Jagger, Ashton Kutcher, David Beckham, Tom Brady, Olivier Dacourt, LeBron James, and Christian Vieri. Brazilian spectators at the game were largely supportive of the Germans as a result of the Argentina–Brazil football rivalry, despite their team's heavy semi-final loss.

Germany were forced to make a late change to their line-up when Khedira sustained a Calf (leg)|calf injury during the warm-up before the match. He was replaced in the line-up by Christoph Kramer, with Germany's team otherwise unchanged from that which started in their win over Brazil in the semi-final.

The weather at Santos Dumont Airport,  from the stadium, and Maracanã, coordinates <!-- Coords rounded -->.}} was recorded as fair at the time of kick-off, becoming partly cloudy later in the evening. Germany won a free kick 3 minutes into the game, when Rojo fouled Müller around  from the Argentina goal. The free kick was hit straight at the Glossary of association football terms#W|wall, and Argentina launched a counterattack from the rebound. Pablo Zabaleta ran with the ball down the right before passing to Higuaín on the edge of the penalty area. He took a shot from a narrow angle, but the ball went wide of Neuer's left-hand goalpost. On 9 minutes, Messi outpaced Hummels on the Argentina right and ran into the penalty area. He attempted to find Ezequiel Lavezzi from the Glossary of association football terms#B|byline but Schweinsteiger reached it first and cleared. Germany had considerably more of the early possession, but a German defensive error on 20 minutes gave Argentina what Jerry Hinnen of CBS Sports called ""the best opportunity for either side"" thus far.

Higuaín had a shot in the first minute of the half after running down the right wing, but it went wide of Neuer's goal. Messi then had an opportunity to score when he was one-on-one with the goalkeeper a minute later, but his low shot on goal also went wide. Argentina had more possession than Germany in the opening 10 minutes of the half, and they had another chance on 50 minutes when Higuaín received a ball just inside the penalty area; he missed the ball with his attempted shot. In the 56th minute, Neuer took down Higuaín in the penalty area, but no penalty was given, despite Argentine commentators believing it should be given. No card was given either. Klose had Germany's first shot on goal of the second half on 59 minutes but his shot lacked power and was caught by Romero. Argentina had an opportunity to score through a Martín Demichelis header four minutes later, but Klose intercepted to send it behind. Shortly afterwards, Javier Mascherano brought down Klose after losing the ball to him, and was booked. His team-mate Agüero was also booked a minute later for a foul on Schweinsteiger. Midway through the second half, ''The Guardian'' Scott Murray commented that the first half had been ""goalless and brilliant"", but the second was ""goalless and ... well, not so much"", although he noted that it remained an open game.<ref name=""GuardianMinuteByMinute""/>

Germany had a chance on 71 minutes, Müller, Schürrle and Özil all getting involved in a build-up which Murray described as ""tiki-taka"", but when Schürrle eventually reached the penalty area with only Romero to beat, he failed to control the ball properly and the goalkeeper claimed it. Messi had a shot on 75 minutes, following a run across the edge of the German penalty area, which he attempted to curl into the top left-hand corner of the goal; it missed the target. Germany appealed for a penalty with 10 minutes remaining, after a tussle close to the Argentina goalpost following a Lahm cross, but the referee awarded a goal kick to Argentina.

Schürrle raced past two defenders on the left before crossing into the penalty area, where Götze controlled the ball on his chest and then volleyed left-footed into the net.

Speaking after the game, Löw said: ""We'd not made this ultimate step before, but champions do what they will do. This team has developed a spirit which is unbelievable."" His Argentine counterpart, Alejandro Sabella, praised his players, describing them as ""warriors"", and felt that they had been unlucky to lose.

The ball weighs 437 grams and has a circumference of 69 centimetres. The ball has been made of six polyurethane panels which have been thermally bonded; the reduction in the number of panels is claimed to increase the consistency in the ball. It is textured to feel more like the Adidas Finale|Adidas Finale 13, the official UEFA Champions League ball, than the Jabulani.

Taipei-based Long Way Enterprise were originally asked to manufacture the ball in their subsidiary YaYork Plastic Products in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China. The company has been associated with production of Adidas balls since 1997.

Long Way, however, was unable to meet the high demand for the ball. A second supplier, Forward Sports (based in Sialkot, Pakistan), was brought in to help manufacture the ball. Forward Sports, who have been associated with Adidas since 1995 and already supplied footballs for both the UEFA Champions League and the German Bundesliga, Each ball is expected to be sold for around US$160.

This article concerns the '''process for determining the host nation of the 2014 FIFA World Cup''', which concluded on 30 October 2007 with the confirmation of Brazil as the hosts.

==Background==
On 7 March 2003, the world football (soccer)|football body FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since Argentina hosted the 1978 FIFA World Cup, in line with its policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup amongst different confederations. On 3 June 2003, CONMEBOL announced that Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia wanted to host the 2014 World Cup finals. By 17 March 2004, the CONMEBOL associations had voted unanimously to adopt Brazil as their sole candidate.

Brazil formally declared its candidacy in December 2006, and Colombia did so as well a few days later. The Argentina bid never materialized. On 11 April 2007, Colombia officially withdrew its bid, making Brazil the only official candidate to host the event in 2014.","[-0.27734375  0.08154297 -0.23046875 ...  0.24316406 -0.00811768

2014 FIFA World Cup bids,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_bids,"Brazil, who eventually won the hosting rights for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, were the only remaining official candidate after Colombia withdrew its bid on 11 April 2007. The Brazilian bid was officially launched on 13 December 2006 by Ricardo Teixeira, then president of the Brazilian Football Confederation, who signed the letter of candidacy in Tokyo in the presence of CONMEBOL president Nicolas Leoz and CONMEBOL general secretary Eduardo De Luca.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated on 4 July 2006 that the 2014 World Cup would probably be held in the country, though he acknowledged in earlier comments that the country did not have any stadiums ready for the Cup at the moment. On 28 September, he met with the Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula, and was quoted as saying he wants the country to prove its capabilities before making a decision. ""But the ball is on Brazil's court now,"" he said. In September 2006, Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva confirmed Blatter's opinion, declaring: ""We don't have any stadium which is in a condition to host World Cup games. We’re going to have to build at least 12 new stadiums in this country.""

Potential host cities are already preparing for the tournament. CBF and government officials have toured many cities and stadiums in the latest months, and 18 states have applied to host World Cup matches. However, the actual number of host cities is expected to be much lower, as FIFA stipulates a minimum of eight and a maximum of ten.

On 31 July 2007, Brazil's bid became official, when the Brazilian Football Confederation president, Ricardo Teixeira, delivered personally to FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, a document containing Brazil's hosting stadiums and other required information concerning plans in improvements for general infrastructure and about finances, though more details about this document are unknown.

Early in that day, a list of stadiums selected was published by Brazilian media. At least 21 cities were considered initially, but only 18 cities were pre selected as able to host international football matches. Among the 18 finalist cities, four stadiums were under construction or would be built if the right to host is won. The three cities not accepted were Campinas (São Paulo (state)|São Paulo), João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa (Paraíba) and Teresina (Piauí). On 17 August 2007, in a meeting between CBF officials and representatives from the 18 cities, Ricardo Teixeira confirmed the names of five host cities, and left the 13 other to fight for the remaining spots. The list below includes the cities selected by the Brazilian Football Confederation to receive the World Cup (the five confirmed cities are mentioned first):

* '''Brasília, Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District - ''Estádio Mané Garrincha'''''
* '''Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais - ''Mineirão|Estádio Magalhães Pinto'''''
* '''Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul - ''Estádio Beira-Rio|Estádio José Pinheiro Borba'''''

* Cuiabá, Mato Grosso - ''Verdão|Estádio Governador José Fragelli''
* Curitiba, Paraná (state)|Paraná - ''Kyocera Arena''

* Maceió, Alagoas - Arena Zagallo (to be built)
* Manaus, Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas - ''Estádio Vivaldo Lima''
* Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal, Rio Grande do Norte - Estrela dos Reis Magos (to be built)
* Recife/Olinda, Pernambuco - ''Arena Recife-Olinda|Recife-Olinda Arena'' (to be built)
* Salvador, Bahia|Salvador, Bahia - Bahia Arena|Arena da Bahia (to be built)

This list would eventually be narrowed down to meet FIFA's requirement that no more than one host city feature two host stadiums. It may also include new stadiums to be built in the next years.

Brazil hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup and has hosted the Copa América four times (South American Championship 1919|1919, South American Championship 1922|1922, South American Championship 1949|1949, Copa América 1989|1989 and later Copa América 2019|2019).

===Colombia===
Colombia formally declared its candidacy on 18 December 2006, and withdrew it on 11 April 2007.

The president of Colombia, Álvaro Uribe, had initially announced on 15 July 2006 that Colombia would submit a bid. During his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, Uribe said: ''""By seeing how things were done to organise these Games, I think Colombia is capable of hosting a football World Cup. I'm sure we will achieve it and will do it very well.""'' Vice President Francisco Santos Calderón was in charge of the project.

Colombia had been set to be the host of the 1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup, but withdrew to the benefit of Mexico because of economic issues, disagreements with FIFA, and concerns about the unstable situation in Colombia at the time. Colombia has hosted the Copa América once (Copa América 2001|2001). However, on 27 February 2007, FIFA president Sepp Blatter appeared to discard any Colombian chances of hosting the event, saying, ""Colombia's bid is more of a public relations presentation of the country to say that we are alive not only in other headlines but also in football.""

===Australia===
In June 2006, South Australian premier Mike Rann put forward a proposal for Australia to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was backed by then Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister John Howard, who said that Australia has proven it can host world sporting events. Football Federation Australia President, Frank Lowy who has also expressed considerable interest in the proposal and is amid negotiations to formally put forward Australia's hosting proposal. Australia hosted the OFC Nations Cup twice (Oceania Nations Cup 1998|1998, and Oceania Nations Cup 2004|2004), and four way co hosted once (Oceania Nations Cup 1996|1996). Australia attempted to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but lost out to Qatar.","[-0.41747496  0.02919988 -0.4757733  ...  0.25436917 -0.25872514

In October 2004, the football federations of Jordan/Iraq mulled a bid to host the World Cup. ''""The situation at the moment would make any bid ludicrous,""'' Prince Prince Faisal bin Al Hussein|Faisal al-Hussein of Jordan was quoted as saying in his interview to ''The Times'' and ''The Guardian''. ''""What will things be like in five years' time?. It could be a very prosperous nation. If the conditions are right, people will take it seriously.""''

===United States===
In June 2002, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) announced it expressed interest to offer a bid for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Robert Contiguglia was confident that the United States can put together a very strong bid. The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as well as the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup.  The United States also attempted to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but lost out to Qatar. It eventually won rights to the 2026 FIFA World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.

The '''Brazil vs Germany''' association football|football match (also known by its score as '''7–1''') that took place on 8 July 2014 at the Mineirão stadium in Belo Horizonte was the first of 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Semi-finals|two semi-final matches of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Both Brazil national football team|Brazil and Germany national football team|Germany reached the semi-finals with an undefeated record in the competition, with the Brazilians' quarter-final with Colombia national football team|Colombia causing them to lose forward Neymar to injury, and defender and captain Thiago Silva to accumulation of yellow cards. Despite the absence of these players, a close match was expected, given both teams performed comparably well throughout the tournament. Also, both were regarded as two of the biggest traditional FIFA World Cup forces, sharing eight tournaments won and having previously met in the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final, where Brazil won 2–0 and earned their fifth title. 

This match, however, ended in a historic loss for Brazil; in a massive show of dominance, Germany led 5–0 within 29 minutes, with four goals being scored inside a six-minute span, and subsequently brought the score up to 7–0 in the second half. Brazil scored a consolation goal through Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar in the last minute, ending the match 7–1. Germany's Toni Kroos was selected as the man of the match.","[ 0.08414714  0.34667346 -0.35366586 ...  0.24399039 -0.21654648

Germany's win marked the largest margin of victory in a FIFA World Cup semi-final. The game saw Germany overtake Brazil as the highest-scoring team in World Cup tournament history and become the first team to reach eight World Cup Finals. Miroslav Klose scored his 16th career World Cup goal and surpassed Brazil's own Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo as FIFA World Cup top goalscorers|the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. Brazil's loss broke their 62-match unbeaten streak at home in competitive matches, going back to the 1975 Copa América (where they lost 3–1 to Peru national football team|Peru in the same stadium), and equalled their biggest margin of defeat in a match alongside a 1920 South American Championship#Matches|6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. It was also Brazil's worst margin of defeat in a World Cup match, with their previous worst loss in that category being their 3–0 loss to France national football team|France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final|1998 final at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis, Paris.

Ultimately, the match was described as a national humiliation. The game has subsequently been dubbed the '''''Mineirazo''''' () in reference to the Mineirão stadium, evoking a previous ""Mongrel complex|spirit of national shame"" known as the ''Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|Maracanaço'' in which Brazil unexpectedly lost in the de facto final of the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay national football team|Uruguay. Brazil subsequently lost 3–0 to the Netherlands national football team|Netherlands in the third-place play-off, while Germany went on to win the World Cup for the fourth time, defeating Argentina national football team|Argentina in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final. This marked Germany’s fourth World Cup triumph, bringing them joint-second behind five-time winners Brazil.

In the 11th minute, the Germans scored from their first corner of the game. Thomas Müller escaped his marker, David Luiz, in the penalty box, and Toni Kroos's delivery found him wide open for a side-footed shot into the net. In the following minutes Brazil tried to respond but their attacks came to nothing, although Philipp Lahm delivered a tackle to keep Marcelo from setting up a chance in the penalty box. Instead, in the 23rd minute, Germany scored again after Kroos and Müller combined to set up Miroslav Klose, who scored on the rebound after his initial shot was saved by goalkeeper Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César.

Klose's goal initiated a flurry of German scoring as Brazil lost control of the game. In the 24th minute, Kroos scored with a left-footed strike from the edge of the area after Lahm's cross was deflected. Then, in the 26th minute, just a few seconds after Brazil kicked off, Kroos caught Fernandinho (footballer, born May 1985)|Fernandinho in possession in his own half and played a one-two with Khedira before scoring again.

By the 60th minute, though, the Germans came close to scoring again, with Júlio César denying Müller twice. Another German goal nonetheless came in the 69th minute – Lahm's low cross found substitute André Schürrle, who side-footed the ball into the net from close range. 10 minutes later, Schürrle ran onto Müller's cross from the left and hit a powerful shot over César at the near post. At this point with the score at 7–0, the remaining home fans gave the Germans a standing ovation, applauding both Schürrle's goal and Germany's overall performance. Close to the end, Özil received a through ball but just missed the chance to make it an eighth goal. Seconds later, Oscar received a long ball and scored in the 90th minute to make it 7–1. The final score matched Brazil's worst loss (1920 South American Championship#Matches|6–0 to Uruguay in 1920) and ended a run of 62 competitive home matches unbeaten for Brazil. The Brazilian players left the pitch in tears to a chorus of boos and jeers.

Toni Kroos was selected List of 2014 FIFA World Cup Man of the match awards|Man of the Match, with three shots, two goals, 93% pass accuracy, one assist and two chances created.<ref name=""numbers"" />

Brazilian striker Fred, who was replaced by Willian (footballer, born 1988)|Willian in the 70th minute, received a particularly hostile reaction from the home fans. According to Opta Sports, Fred failed to make a single tackle, cross, run or interception during the match, and actually spent the majority of his time in possession of the ball on the centre spot due to six restarts.

Germany equalled the record for most goals scored against the host nation of the World Cup, with Austria defeating Switzerland national football team|Switzerland Austria v Switzerland (1954 FIFA World Cup)|7–5 in the 1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup. Germany also overtook Brazil to become the all-time highest-scoring team in FIFA World Cup history, their total of 223 at full-time passing Brazil's 221.

For Brazil, the result became one of their two worst losses, equalling a 1920 South American Championship#Final round|6–0 defeat to Uruguay national football team|Uruguay in Valparaíso in 1920, and was their worst defeat at home; their previous worst defeat at home was a 5–1 defeat by Argentina national football team|Argentina in Rio de Janeiro in 1939. The loss broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches, dating back to their 1–3 loss to Peru national football team|Peru in the 1975 Copa América; this match was also played at Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte. The last time Brazil had lost a World Cup semi-final was in 1938, in a dramatic game against Italy in Marseille, and had emerged victorious from this stage the previous six times they had reached it, since the loss in 1974 against Netherlands was not formally a semi-final. Brazil had never before conceded seven goals at home, although they once conceded eight goals in an 8–4 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia on 3 June 1934; the last time they conceded at least five was in a Brazil v Poland (1938 FIFA World Cup)|6–5 win in the 1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup versus Poland national football team|Poland; at least four was in a Battle of Berne (1954 FIFA World Cup)|4–2 defeat at the 1954 World Cup against Hungary.

File:Toni Kroos, Germany national football team (02).jpg|thumb|Man of the Match Toni Kroos. His two goals in 69 seconds were the fastest brace in the history of the FIFA World Cup. He would later express sorrow on behalf of his defeated adversaries, considering them ""not in their best performance"".<ref name=kroos/> 
According to reports, after Germany had scored their fifth goal with Khedira, Neymar, who was also watching the match on television in his home in Guarujá, Brazil, switched off his set and went to play poker. World Cup-winning Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari said the result was the ""worst loss by a Brazilian national team ever"" and accepted all responsibility for the defeat. He called it ""the worst day of my life"", and resigned after the tournament. Stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César both offered apologies to the people of Brazil. Fred (footballer, born 1983)|Fred, who was booed by Brazilian fans during the match, said it was the worst defeat in his and his teammates' careers. He later announced his retirement from international football following the tournament. Recovering from his injury, Neymar expressed his support to his teammates and, despite the 7–1 score, said he was proud to be a part of the team.

During the match, the German team seemed to realise that what was unfolding was not a normal football event. In a post-match statement, Mats Hummels said that the German team had decided that they did not want to humiliate the Brazilians during the second half and after the match:

{{blockquote|We just made it clear that we had to stay focused and not try to humiliate them. We said we had to stay serious and concentrate at half-time. That's something you don't have to show on the pitch if you are playing.
You have to show the opponent respect and it was very important that we did this and didn't try to show some magic or something like this. It was important we played our game for 90 minutes.}}

Accordingly, the Germans cut theatrics from their goal celebrations; arms were raised but there was no jumping or screaming after scoring. Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in ""no game of the Cup, [the Brazilians] played their best"", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: ""we took all the balls, and scored the goals"". Müller said he was ""shocked by just how open Brazil were"" as ""Gustavo, Luiz, Dante, Fernandinho and Marcelo were shambolic in their positioning"", being confused and disorganized, noting that his German teammates benefited overwhelmingly as ""the spaces were bigger than against defence-minded teams"".

Löw also declared the team had ""no euphoria"" during or after the game,","[ 0.18189135  0.1422748  -0.17412838 ...  0.21636702 -0.3953546

Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_v_Germany_(2014_FIFA_World_Cup),"Following the match, the German players and managers offered words of consolation to the Brazilians. Löw and players Per Mertesacker and Philipp Lahm even compared the pressure on the Brazilian team and resulting heartbreaking defeat with Germany's own when they hosted the 2006 FIFA World Cup and also lost in the semifinals. Lahm added in an interview after the tournament that he had felt ""very uneasy"" during the match and ""not at all euphoric"" since the Brazilian team had made mistakes that ""don't usually happen at this level"", and Mertesacker noted that despite featuring the Germans at the top of their game, ""even from the bench, [the semifinal] was crazy to watch"". Löw observed in the immediate aftermath of the match that the Brazilian people were applauding his team.

Brazilian footballing icon Pelé tweeted, ""I always said that football is a box of surprises. Nobody in this world expected this result,"" followed by, ""[Brazil] Will try to get the sixth title 2018 FIFA World Cup|in Russia. Congratulations to Germany."" In contrast, Argentinian icon Diego Maradona was seen singing a song mocking the Brazilian defeat.

===Society===
In Germany, the match's coverage by ZDF set a record for the country's List of most watched television broadcasts#Germany|most watched TV broadcast, with 32.57&nbsp;million viewers (87.8% of all viewers), beating the Germany–Spain match at the 2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup. This record was beaten five days later with the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final. In contrast, despite a weekly spike in audience, the broadcast by Brazilian TV Globo saw the viewers total fall with each German goal.

File:Dilma_Rousseff_-_foto_oficial_2011-01-09.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Brazil's defeat was lamented by the nation's President, Dilma Rousseff.
The match was the most discussed sports game on Twitter with over 35.6 million tweets, surpassing Super Bowl XLVIII, with 24.9&nbsp;million tweets during the game. At first incentive hashtags such as ""#PrayForBrazil"" were common, but once Germany built a 5–0 lead Brazilian users instead lent their frustration into Self-deprecation|self-deprecatory humor, comparing Germany's goals with the Volkswagen Gol car and stating the Brazilian team looked like ""11 Fred (footballer, born 1983)|Freds"". Other Twitter users compared Germany's dominating performance to their military efforts during World War II and The Holocaust, for example, dubbing it the ""Goalocaust"". Bung Moktar Radin, a member of parliament of Malaysia, came under heavy criticism from the Malaysian public and the German ambassador, Holger Michael, for posting such a comment. Many comments had derisive sexual connotations, like ""Brazilian team decided to file a case in the court against Germany for gang rape."" Pornhub issued a plea to stop uploading highlight videos of the match under titles like ""Young Brazilians get fucked by entire German soccer team.""","[-0.09035403  0.03442988 -0.26752827 ...  0.3337307  -0.2349146

Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_v_Germany_(2014_FIFA_World_Cup),"The President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, stated on Twitter following the match that ""like all Brazilians, I am deeply saddened by our loss."" The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Yigal Palmor, mentioned the match when countering Brazil's claim that his country was using disproportionate force in the 2014 Gaza Conflict|Gaza conflict, saying ""This is not football. In football, when a game ends in a draw, you think it is proportional, but when it finishes 7–1 it's disproportionate.""

Due to the pressure on the home nation Brazil, who were odds-on favorites to win the World Cup, and the subsequent shock of the loss, the media and FIFA dubbed the game the ''Mineirazo'' (''Mineiraço'' in Brazil), meaning ""The Mineirão blow"", evoking the ''Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|Maracanazo'' (''Maracanaço'') in which Brazil were defeated on home soil by outsiders Uruguay in the ''de facto'' final of the 1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup. The daughter of goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa, who was Scapegoating|scapegoated for the 1950 defeat, said the loss was enough to redeem her father's legacy, Following the match, German fans were escorted out of the stadium by police and police were put on alert for possible riots. Observers noted that while the German supporters had shown respect to the defeated hosts, Argentinian fans were celebrating Brazil's elimination.

There were reports of a mass robbery at a fan party in Rio de Janeiro and of fans flag desecration|setting fire to flag of Brazil|Brazilian flags in the streets of São Paulo even before the match was over. A number of buses were burned across São Paulo and an electronics store was looted.

===Media===
Brazilian newspapers greeted the result with headlines such as ""The Biggest Shame in History"" (''Lance!''), a ""Historical humiliation"" (''Folha de S.Paulo'') and ""Brazil is slain"" (''O Globo''). German paper ''Bild'' heralded the ""7–1 Madness"" by the ""Lightning DFB team"", with a front page headline of ""Ohne Worte"" (Without Words). The French ''L'Équipe'' simply said, ""Le Désastre"" (The Disaster). Writing for Sky Sports, Matthew Stanger described the game as the ""ultimate embarrassment"", while Miguel Delaney of ESPN referred to the match as the ''Mineirazo'', echoing the term invented for the event by the South American Spanish language press.","[-0.04674199 -0.05164931 -0.3375138  ...  0.27742776 -0.17109096

Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_v_Germany_(2014_FIFA_World_Cup),"Barney Ronay in ''The Guardian'' described it as ""the most humiliating World Cup host nation defeat of all time"", and Joe Callaghan of ''The Independent'' described it as ""the darkest night in Brazil's footballing history"". Wyre Davies, the BBC's Rio de Janeiro correspondent, said of Brazilian's reactions at the stadium and fan parks, ""The collective sense of shock, embarrassment and national humiliation across Brazil was impossible to ignore"". Football journalist Tim Vickery postulated that the result might be the catalyst for overdue reform of Brazilian club football, which in his opinion had become complacent in comparison to other countries, resting on the laurels of the national team's history of success. In his words, this was a chance to ""recapture parts of its historic identity and reframe them in a modern, global context"". Reporters compared the result with the ''Maracanazo'' that Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|cost Brazil a title at home in 1950,

Analysts deconstructed all the tactical and technical deficiencies that led to the blowout result. Scolari still relied on the team that won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup despite many players going through dry spells, and most of them not having any World Cup experience. Neymar was such a focal point that the team barely trained any formations without him. The defense that had already been questioned in previous games collapsed as Dante was proven to be an inadequate replacement for the suspended Silva, while David Luiz made uncharacteristic errors during the semi-final.

==Aftermath==
As a result of being eliminated in the semi-finals, Brazil played in the third place game at the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in Brasília, and never got to play at their home stadium of the Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro for the entire tournament despite being hosts. Brazil finished fourth after being defeated 3–0 in the 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Third place play-off|third place play-off by the Netherlands national football team|Netherlands on 12 July, where two of the three goals were conceded in the first 17 minutes. The defeat meant that Brazil had conceded a total of 14 goals throughout the tournament, which was the most they had conceded in a single tournament, the most conceded by a World Cup host, and the most conceded by any team since Belgium national football team|Belgium allowed 15 during 1986 FIFA World Cup|the 1986 tournament. Germany went on to win the World Cup for the fourth time and the first as a German reunification|unified nation, after defeating Argentina national football team|Argentina 1–0 in extra time in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final|Final on 13 July at the Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã. Germany had the support of the Brazilian crowd despite having eliminated the home team, given Brazil has a Argentina–Brazil football rivalry|long-standing football rivalry with neighbours Argentina.","[-2.9983390e-01 -1.0572097e-01 -4.2089230e-01 ...  1.8985106e-01

Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_v_Germany_(2014_FIFA_World_Cup),"The two consecutive losses, Brazil's first consecutive home defeats since 1940, led to coach Luiz Felipe Scolari|Scolari's resignation on 15 July. Two weeks later, the Brazilian Football Confederation brought back Dunga as head coach of the Brazil national team. He had managed the team from 2006 until 2010, being dismissed following a 2–1 loss to the Netherlands in the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals.

The Brazil senior team did not play a match at the Estádio Mineirão again until a 3–0 win over Argentina national football team|Argentina in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|World Cup qualifier in November 2016. 

Brazil and Germany's next meeting in a major tournament was two years later when their under-23 teams faced each other in the Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament – Final|gold medal match of the 2016 Summer Olympics' men's tournament at the Maracanã as Rio de Janeiro hosted the Games. Both opposing coaches — Rogerio Micale for Brazil and Horst Hrubesch for Germany — downplayed the fact that the gold medal match was a rematch of the World Cup semifinal, but some fans viewed the Olympic final as a chance for revenge and redemption. Brazil won 5–4 on penalties to win their first Olympic football gold medal after the match finished 1–1 after both normal time and extra time, with Neymar scoring the winning penalty. The next time Brazil and Germany faced each other again at senior level  after the 2014 World Cup was a Exhibition game#Association football|friendly at the Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion in Berlin in March 2018; Brazil won 1–0 on a first half goal from Gabriel Jesus. 

In Brazil, the result, ""7–1"" (), has become a metaphor for a devastating and crushing defeat, while ""Goal for Germany"" () is used as an exclamation after a mishap.

2014 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_broadcasting_rights,"The broadcasting rights for the 2014 FIFA World Cup were sold directly by FIFA, or through licensed companies or organizations such as the European Broadcasting Union, Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana, African Union of Broadcasting, International Media Content, Inter-Sports Marketing, M-League, Dentsu, RS International Broadcasting & Sports Management and MP & Silva. Airlines companies such as Etihad Airways had in-flight live telecasts of all 64 matches.

The '''caxirola''' () is a Brazilian percussion instrument created by Carlinhos Brown and consisting of a closed plastic basket with a flat-bottom filled with small synthetic particles, in an attempt to create a sustainable product. It was based on the caxixi, and thus it is also an indirectly struck idiophone, sounded by shaking. The caxirola was certified on September 27, 2012 by the Brazilian Ministry of Sports and was created to be the official musical instrument of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. However, it was not allowed inside stadiums of both the World Cup and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup as the government considered it a security risk.","[-0.03051758  0.33203125  0.00172424 ... -0.05859375  0.07910156

Caxirola,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caxirola,"Carlinhos Brown has expressed concern about the potential unpleasing sound of the official instrument of the Cup, as it happened with the vuvuzelas of the 2010 FIFA World Cup|previous tournament. According to him, ""''the caxirola respects the sound limits. It reproduces sounds of nature, of the sea, because of that, we worked with the best acoustic engineers so that the sound was nice, pleasant.''"" ""Researchers at Brazil's Universidade Federal de Santa Maria|Federal University of Santa Maria determined .. that it would take 30,000 caxirolas to produce the same sound pressure level as a single vuvuzela.""<ref>{{Cite news

Brown also said Aldo Rebelo and FIFA representatives followed the creation of the instrument closely, and it is now part of the official licensed products of FIFA.<ref name=""G1""/>

The instrument was presented at the opening of a festival called ""O Olhar que Ouve"" (''The Look that Hears''), made up of 19 works of art by Brown. The caxirolas were tested by Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who claimed they were ""more beautiful than the vuvuzelas"".

Caxirola,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caxirola,"In March 2013, FIFA tried to forbid the usage of the instrument during games, claiming it could be used as a weapon or as a method of publicity. The instruments resemble the shape and design of hand grenades. Indeed, during the Ba-Vi|derby between Salvador, Bahia|Salvador's two biggest clubs, Esporte Clube Bahia|Bahia and Esporte Clube Vitória|Vitória on 28 April 2013, the first match in which the caxirola was given to the public, Bahia supporters threw hundreds of them on the field of Arena Fonte Nova as a result of their team's 5–1 loss to their rivals.

In late May 2013, it was confirmed by José Eduardo Cardozo, Brazilian Minister of Justice, that the instrument would not be allowed into stadiums during both football events to take place in Brazil in 2013 and 2014.<ref name=OESP/>

The instrument was met with criticism by people who work towards the preservation of traditional cultures of Brazil, claiming that the caxirola is nothing but a copy of caxixi, simply adding slots for the fingers (such as brass knuckles) and that the native and ancient cultures of Brazil should be recognized as the true creators of the instruments and, as such, be benefited with that.","[ 0.26171875 -0.0559082  -0.24609375 ...  0.06030273  0.14648438

List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2014_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies,"The '''2014 FIFA World Cup''' in Brazil generated various Controversy|controversies, including demonstrations, some of which took place even before the tournament started. Most centred on 2014 FIFA World Cup officials|officiating, with Referee (association football)|referees  coming under criticism for their performances. Furthermore, there were various issues with safety, including eight deaths of workers and a fire during construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable makeshift staircase at the Maracanã Stadium, a monorail collapse, and the Belo Horizonte overpass collapse|collapse of an unfinished overpass in Belo Horizonte. The most notable disciplinary case was that of Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez, who was disciplined after biting an Italian player, defender Giorgio Chiellini, during a game.

==Before the tournament==
===Protests===
File:Protest against the World Cup in Copacabana (2014-06-12) 12.jpg|thumb|Anti-World Cup demonstration on the opening day.

Prior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place outside Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha|the venue, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup. Both President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff and FIFA President Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches at the 2013 tournament's opening, which resulted in FIFA announcing that the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony|2014 World Cup opening ceremony would not feature any speeches. Further protests took place outside other matches during the Confederations Cup as part of wider 2013 protests in Brazil|unrest and rioting in Brazilian cities, seeking to express disenchantment with the government's financial management of the country.<ref name=""Confederations Cup opening protests""/>

The weeks preceding the 2014 World Cup, as well as the first days of the tournament, featured further unrest and protests across the country against the spending. Unlike at the Confederations Cup, however, security forces managed to prevent any protests from reaching the stadiums.

While covering a protest for CNN during the 12 June opening game, reporter Shasta Darlington and producer Barbara Arvanitidis were injured. Arvanitidis was directly hit on the wrist by a tear-gas bomb while they were reporting the indiscriminate use of riot weapons.

Blatter said that the protesters ""should not use football to make their demands heard"", and that the public expenditure on staging the tournaments was on ""items that are for the future, not just for the World Cup"".

A mural by street artist Paulo Ito became a global viral phenomenon in the month before the World Cup. The spray paint and latex work depicted a black child sobbing at a dinner table, with nothing on his plate but a football.","[-0.37518272  0.27263734 -0.45882055 ...  0.30667922 -0.13215725

List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2014_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies,"Former Brazilian footballer and now political figure Romário labelled the tournament ""the biggest theft in history"", saying that he believed its real cost would exceed Brazilian real|R$100 billion (Pound sterling|£26 billion/Euro|€32 billion/United States dollar|US$45 billion). He called for a deeper investigation into the widespread misuse of public funds, which he identified as the reason for the continuing protests. Nevertheless, he was criticised by the ruling Workers' Party for receiving R$1 million to appear in two Television advertisement|TV advertisements which promoted the World Cup.

Directly before the tournament, President Rousseff reiterated her assurances of the previous year that all the implemented public works had long-term benefits for Brazilians.

===Budweiser bill===
After numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law in 2003 Alcohol law#Restrictions on sale and possession|outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the World Cup because Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor, was the ""Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup"", a role it had played since 1986. In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the ""Budweiser Bill"".

===Seeding of France===
There was some controversy before the draw when FIFA decided upon their 2014 FIFA World Cup seeding|allocation of the draw pots. Only eight sides were seeded for the World Cup draw: the hosts plus the seven sides ranked highest in the October 2013 FIFA World Rankings. The remaining 24 unseeded sides were allocated to three pots based on their geographical locations. However, there were still nine unseeded European sides, which meant that one European side had to be allocated to Pot 2, which otherwise consisted of African and South American sides. A similar situation arose with the 2006 FIFA World Cup seeding|2006 World Cup seeding, and on that occasion the lowest ranked European side at the time of the draw, Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro, were placed in the alternative pot.

For the 2014 draw, FIFA decided that the European team in Pot 2 would be drawn there randomly. France national football team|France would have been the lowest ranked side, and many<ref name="":1"" /> thought, based on the 2006 precedent, that the rule change benefitted them.

Many officials, fans, and journalists complained, pointing out that a Frenchman, FIFA secretary general Jérôme Valcke, suggested the change, and suspecting that another influential Frenchman, UEFA president Michel Platini, helped approve it. Instead, Italy national football team|Italy were drawn into Pot 2 and ended up in a 2014 FIFA World Cup Group D|difficult group. The next day, a headline in the Italian sports periodical ''Corriere dello Sport – Stadio|Corriere Dello Sport'' read, ""2014 World Cup draw: What a scandal!"".

==Group stage==
===Brazil vs Croatia===
The Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura faced heavy criticism for his performance in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group A#Brazil vs Croatia|Group A opening match between Croatia national football team|Croatia and the host team Brazil national football team|Brazil as several decisions favoured the host nation.","[-0.54832983  0.05800299 -0.38809183 ...  0.09533574 -0.08529985

List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2014_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies,"In the 71st minute, the Croatian defender Dejan Lovren put his hands below the Brazilian striker Fred (footballer, born 1983)|Fred's arms in the Croatian penalty area, after which Fred fell down. Nishimura awarded Brazil a Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick which Neymar converted for their second goal in a 3–1 win. The call was condemned by various sources, including former top-level FIFA referees, newspaper writers, players from other teams and fans in Nishimura's home country, saying that Lovren's contact was minimal and that Fred diving (association football)|went down on his own. Twelve minutes later, the Croatians had an equaliser controversially disallowed for a supposed foul by Croatian forward Ivica Olić on the Brazilian goalkeeper Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César.

Earlier in the game, in the 26th minute, Neymar elbowed the Croatian midfielder Luka Modrić, after which Neymar was shown a Yellow card (association football)|yellow card. At that time Croatia were leading the game 1–0. Many critics agreed that Neymar's punishment was too lenient and that Neymar should have been shown a Red card (association football)|red card.

Renowned former top-level FIFA referee Markus Merk questioned FIFA's appointment of Nishimura in the opening match, labelling the refereeing as ""embarrassing"". Massimo Busacca, the head of refereeing development at FIFA, defended Nishimura's penalty kick decision and insisted that Dejan Lovren's contact was significant enough.

===Mexico vs Cameroon: Giovani's two disallowed goals===
In the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group A#Mexico vs Cameroon|Group A game between Mexico national football team|Mexico and Cameroon national football team|Cameroon, Mexican midfielder Giovani dos Santos had two goals wrongly disallowed for offside in the first half. Replays showed that he was in line with the second to last defender for the first, while the ball came from a deliberate play by a Cameroonian player for the second. Following the game, which Mexico won 1–0, Amy Lawrence of ''The Guardian'' described the tournament as having ""incompetent officiating"", and called for FIFA president Sepp Blatter to allow team managers to challenge two decisions per match with video review, a possibility that Blatter discussed before the tournament.  On 20 June 2014, FIFA announced that they had removed the Colombian assistant referee responsible for the incidents, Humberto Clavijo, from further officiating at the tournament.

===Brazil vs Mexico ===
Both Brazilian and Mexican fans abused each other with homophobic chants during the match.

===Spain vs Netherlands: Behaviour of Diego Costa===
Much attention ahead of the tournament had focused on the switch of Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to Spain national football team|Spain. Costa returned to his native land for his World Cup debut, only for his new team to lose 5–1 to the Netherlands national football team|Netherlands in their 2014 FIFA World Cup Group B#Spain vs Netherlands|opening game in Group B. Jeers and insults were heard from the local fans throughout the match. Costa also noticeably headbutted his opponent Bruno Martins Indi during the game and was subsequently substituted by his coach Vicente del Bosque for striker Fernando Torres.

In the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group G#Germany vs Portugal|Group G game between Germany national football team|Germany and Portugal national football team|Portugal, there were some contentious decisions by the Serbian referee, Milorad Mažić.

In the 12th minute, Mažić awarded Germany a Penalty kick (association football)|penalty as the Portuguese defender João Pereira (footballer, born 1984)|João Pereira held back the German midfielder Mario Götze, and gave Pereira a Yellow card (association football)|yellow card for the foul. The Portuguese players, including a very agitated Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|Pepe, surrounded Mažić in protest. Germany's Thomas Müller scored the penalty to give Germany team a 1–0 lead. ''The Daily Telegraph'''s Mark Ogden labelled it ""another example of questionable refereeing at this World Cup as contact appeared slight, certainly not enough to force Götze, who made the most of the challenge, off his feet"".

In the 37th minute, Portuguese defender Pepe headbutted Thomas Müller,
and was shown a straight Red card (association football)|red card.
The former World Cup referee Brian Hall (referee)|Brian Hall condemned Müller for Diving (association football)|using theatrical action to ""gain unfair advantage"" by ""tricking the referee"".
The situation turned out to be the match's biggest talking point with observer reaction generally centred on the condemnation of Pepe's actions and whether Müller overemphasised the initial contact.

In the 75th minute, Mažić failed to award a Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick to Portugal, prompting much irritation from the players. Germany ended up winning 4–0, with Müller scoring three goals. In his post-match comments, Bento said Mažić showed ""bias"" on both occasions, adding, ""I am not saying it was only the referee's fault. We also made mistakes but the circumstances of what happened in the first half made the rest of the game difficult for us...The sending-off was forced on the player. I don't know if it was because of Pepe's reputation. It depends what sort of a reputation you think Pepe has.""

===Cameroon vs Croatia: Assou-Ekotto headbutts his teammate===
Much attention was given to apparent action of Benoît Assou-Ekotto to headbutt his Cameroonian teammate, Benjamin Moukandjo. The incident was seemingly missed by officials but was captured on playback. Assou-Ekotto later attributed this to frustration. Cameroon's Alex Song also earned a red card by elbowing Croatian forward Mario Mandžukić in the back in the same game.

Shortly afterwards, Pinto decided to charge at the referee's assistant, with Costa Rica's staff and substitutes following his lead. Former World Cup referee Graham Poll later tweeted, ""HUGE moment in this match, how have Costa Rica not got a penalty?! Joel Campbell gets behind the Italy defence to race through on goal before he is clumsily brought down by a push from Giorgio Chiellini."" Nevertheless, Costa Rican midfielder Bryan Ruiz scored a goal within a minute, which was eventually the game winner for Costa Rica as they won 1–0.

===Argentina vs Iran===
File:Iran vs. Argentina match, 2014 FIFA World Cup 36.jpg|thumb|Iran national team players Ashkan Dejagah and Masoud Shojaei protesting Milorad Mažić
During the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group F#Argentina vs Iran|Group F game between Argentina national football team|Argentina and Iran national football team|Iran, Serbian referee Milorad Mažić allegedly failed to award a Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick that would have favoured Iran. In addition to sparking a furious response from the Iranian players who rushed and bumped the referee, Mažić's non-call on Argentine defender Pablo Zabaleta's penalty area challenge on Iranian midfielder Ashkan Dejagah in the 55th minute produced a post-match discussion on whether a foul had been committed. Iranian print media, including the ''Jam-e-jam'', ''Quds'', and ''Iran (newspaper)|Iran'' daily newspapers, lambasted Mažić over his decision not to award a penalty shot, citing him as the reason Argentina won the match, Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey of Pravda.ru declared Mažić ""either biased or incompetent"" before proclaiming his 55th minute decision ""a disgusting comment on the quality of referees chosen to manage the games of the FIFA World Cup"", ''Metro (British newspaper)|Metro'' wrote that despite Zabaleta getting his toe to the ball when tackling Dejagah, ""replays showed Iran should've been awarded a spot-kick"", felt Dejagah had a ""strong claim for a penalty"". However, ''The Guardian'''s Barney Ronay and the Associated Press's Karl Ritter wrote in their reports that television replays suggest Zabaleta had gotten a touch on the ball first before bringing down Dejagah and therefore did not foul the Iranian. ''The Daily Telegraph'' also thought that the call was correct: ""[Dejagah] is screaming for a penalty, so much so that he almost manhandles the referee in his frustration. I've no idea why, as replays suggest Zabaleta won the ball, albeit a little clumsily.""","[-0.5089558   0.22528522 -0.07679711 ...  0.27081746 -0.1694455

There's no excuse. There's nothing that can explain [why] this Serbian referee [did] not give the penalty. How can this guy sleep tonight, or for the rest of his life? With all respect, I would like to have the opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation with him. Why did he do that to us?""

===Nigeria vs Bosnia and Herzegovina: Džeko's disallowed goal===
During the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group F#Nigeria vs Bosnia and Herzegovina|Group F match between Nigeria national football team|Nigeria and Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina, New Zealand referee Peter O'Leary (referee)|Peter O'Leary disallowed a goal to Bosnia and Herzegovina due to an incorrect offside call from his assistant. Nigeria won the game 1–0, which meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina were mathematically eliminated from advancing to the 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage. The referee was later pictured appearing to celebrate with Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama after the match's end, an incident that Bosnian forward Edin Džeko, the scorer of the disallowed goal, called ""shameful"".

On 9 November 2014, Peter O'Leary, the game referee speaking to ''The New Zealand Herald'' admitted Džeko's goal was disallowed in error.

===Greece vs Ivory Coast===
In the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group C#Greece vs Ivory Coast|final Group C game between Greece national football team|Greece and Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast, Ecuadorean referee Carlos Vera awarded Greece a late Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick in the 91st minute of the match when he called a foul on Ivory Coast forward Giovanni Sio in a play where replays showed that Greek midfielder Georgios Samaras stubbed his foot into the pitch after the contact and fell down, which has been seen as controversial. Samaras converted the subsequent penalty kick to give Greece a 2–1 victory, which meant that they would advance on to the 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage. Had the penalty not been called, Ivory Coast would have advanced in a 1–1 draw. FIFA, however, accepted the penalty by appointing the referee as Fourth Official on the Final.

===Croatia vs Mexico===
During the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group A#Croatia vs Mexico|Group A match between Croatia national football team|Croatia and Mexico national football team|Mexico, the Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov declined awarding a Penalty kick (association football)|penalty after a possible handball by the Croatian defender Darijo Srna and did not send off Rafael Márquez, who later scored the first goal.

List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2014_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies,"In the 59th minute, the Italian midfielder Claudio Marchisio made a high challenge on Egidio Arévalo Ríos and was shown a straight red card by the referee. Italy's coach Cesare Prandelli argued against this decision and claimed that the Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez had been showing bias against Italy national football team|Italy, which had ruined the game for the Azzurri.

In the 79th minute of the match, Uruguay's striker Luis Suárez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Suárez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder, after which Suárez fell and clutched his face. As the Italian players protested to Rodríguez for not penalising Suárez, Uruguay won a corner and their defender Diego Godín scored. The game finished 1–0 to Uruguay, allowing them to qualify to the 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage as the Group D runners-up. Italy, who had also lost their previous game, were eliminated, finishing third in the group. It was the second successive time they had failed to qualify past the group stage in a World Cup, having won it in 2006.

Suárez had been found guilty of biting opponents on two previous occasions: Otman Bakkal in 2010 and Branislav Ivanović in 2013. He received a seven-game ban for the first incident and a ten-game ban for the second, where he was criticised for not recognising ""the seriousness"" of it.","[-0.47657555  0.24499965 -0.0827176  ...  0.26313633 -0.38780993

List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2014_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies,"On 26 June 2014, the FIFA Disciplinary Code|FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique at the 1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup. He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity, including entering any stadium, for four months and fined Swiss franc|CHF100,000 (approx. Pound sterling|£65,700/Euro|€82,000/United States dollar|US$119,000). The severity of the penalty was due to the fact that it was Suárez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse. With Suárez banned, Uruguay lost 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Colombia vs Uruguay|their next match 2–0 to Colombia national football team|Colombia and were knocked out of the World Cup.

On the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal against the decision. Suárez's lawyer claimed that ""we don't have any doubts"" of a European-based campaign against Suárez. Various Uruguayan individuals defended Suárez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticised the severity of his ban, including the President of Uruguay José Mujica, who labelled the ban ""Fascism|fascist"" and called FIFA ""a bunch of old sons of bitches""; the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) president Wilmar Valdez, and their coach Óscar Tabárez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest. The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood. Chiellini called the ban ""excessive"", while the international players' union FIFPro called for Suárez to ""receive all the support he needs"" and that the ""focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment"" of Suárez.<ref name=""reactions""/>

Six days after the incident, on 30 June, Suárez apologised to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the ""physical result of a bite"" occurred in a collision with Chiellini. Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating that all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Suárez's suspension.

On 3 July, the AUF appealed against Suárez's ban, but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July. With the ban not preventing Suárez from Transfer (association football)|transferring to another club, it was announced on 11 July that Suárez had agreed to move to FC Barcelona|Barcelona. Before the transfer, Barcelona's club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was ""honourable"", their sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Suárez as being ""humble enough to admit an error"" and their new signing Ivan Rakitić commended Suárez's ""character and strength"".

A win for Russia would have seen them qualify, and they led the game 1–0 after six minutes with a goal from forward Aleksandr Kokorin. In the 60th minute of the game, a moving green light – most likely produced by a laser pointer – was shone in Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev's face while he was defending from an Algerian free-kick, which striker Islam Slimani scored from to equalise. Russia's coach Fabio Capello blamed the laser for the decisive conceded goal, saying, ""The goalkeeper was unable to do his job. The laser was in his face. It is not an excuse. You can see the footage.""

After the match, the Algerian Football Federation (AFF) was fined Swiss franc|CHF50,000 (approx. Pound sterling|£33,000/Euro|€41,100/United States dollar|US$56,200) by FIFA for the use of lasers and other violations of the rules by Algerian fans in the stadium. Laser pointers were a prohibited item in the stadium, according to FIFA Stadium Safety and Security Regulations.

==Knockout stage==
===Brazil vs Chile===
The 2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Brazil vs Chile|first Round of 16 match, between Brazil national football team|Brazil and Chile national football team|Chile, resulted in some confusions and controversies.

There was some doubt if the first goal of the match, scored by Brazil, was an own goal by Chile defender Gonzalo Jara (footballer, born 1985)|Gonzalo Jara, although FIFA confirmed that the goal was scored by Brazil's David Luiz.

English referee Howard Webb was criticised for calls which might have been too close or harsh, especially against Brazil: BBC Sport commentator and former England striker Gary Lineker said in a video that Webb made some ""iffy decisions"", such as denying a Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick award to Brazil forward Hulk (footballer)|Hulk at 13 minutes ""that looked like it possibly was"", and calling a handball against the same player at 55 minutes that was ""a little bit harsh"". Hulk had put the ball into Chile's net, but the referee ruled that he had controlled the ball using his arm. The goal was disallowed and he was shown the Yellow card (association football)|yellow card. Other commentators (including former England footballer Michael Owen, via Twitter) also questioned the handball decision against Hulk (made by English assistant referee Michael Mullarkey) as being a call which might have been too close.

Brazilian coach Scolari criticized the refereeing, mentioning that opposition teams were trying to injure Neymar, saying he had experienced the same thing with Cristiano Ronaldo when he was coaching Portugal.

Portuguese referee Pedro Proença waved to ""play on"", though Moreno's foul was so hard that he broke his own shinbone and had to be stretchered off the field.<br>
While the score was 1–1, one minute into stoppage time of the second half, Robben again went down inside the area following another foul by Márquez, in which Márquez stepped on Robben's foot. This time the Netherlands was given a Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick, which striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar converted for the game-winning goal, eliminating Mexico with a 2–1 win. Robben, who has a reputation for diving (association football)|diving, was condemned widely in the press for his ""theatrical fall"" to earn the decisive penalty.
After the match, Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera was seen arguing with referee Proença and later claimed, in an interview, ""This was a World Cup where everyone was against Mexico."" After the match, Robben admitted to going to ground too easily once during the game and said, ""I must apologize. The one [at the end] was a penalty, but the other one just outside the box I went to ground too easily. I shouldn't be doing that."" Robben also said that the pair of fouls against him, while he was inside the box during the first half, should have been awarded a penalty. Márquez claimed that Robben confessed to him at the end of the match that ""it [the 90'+1 tackle] wasn't a penalty, though one of the previous was""; the Royal Dutch Football Association suggested that Robben's words were mistranslated.

In the aftermath of the event, many Mexican fans used the phrase ""No era penal"" () for a number of years to refer to the moment. Robben offered a retorte in 2016 against those using said phrase saying to Grant Wahl ""you have to admit already in the first half they didn’t give me a penalty, and it should have been a penalty. And the penalty itself, it was a penalty.""

Geiger was criticised for several calls throughout the game. This included a goal by Nigerian striker Emmanuel Emenike being cancelled for offside (although television replays suggest this may have been the correct decision); no Red card (association football)|red card for an apparent attempt by French striker Olivier Giroud to elbow Nigerian midfielder Mikel, no penalty being called against French left-back Patrice Evra for holding Odemwingie during a corner, a general lack of protection from the referee for persistent rough play and, most notably, only a Yellow card (association football)|yellow card being issued for a studs-in tackle by French midfielder Blaise Matuidi, which resulted in midfielder Onazi's left leg tendon being torn apart and requiring surgery, and forced to be substituted for midfielder Reuben Gabriel. Several commentators like Allan Jiang of Bleacherreport and Patrick Johnson of Yahoo! News noted that the decisions significantly impacted the match, especially the forced substitution of Onazi, which changed the complexion of the game, depriving Nigeria of its most influential midfielder.

The action was not punished with a card nor even a foul. Subsequent medical evaluation discovered a bone fracture|fractured Vertebra (anatomy)|vertebra, forcing the Brazilian to miss the remainder of the tournament. After the match, which Colombia lost 2–1, Zúñiga insisted that he had not meant to injure Neymar. Neymar's teammate Thiago Silva defended Zúñiga, stating that he is not the type of player who would purposely cause an injury to any player. On 5 July, it was revealed that Zúñiga had sent a letter of apology to Neymar, saying that he was ""deeply sorry and sad"" for unintentionally causing the injury. On the other hand, Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo believed that Zúñiga intended to hurt Neymar, saying that the very high knee in the back was violent and an unlawful move.

Many media and football figures, such as Diego Maradona, criticised FIFA and the Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo, claiming ""favouritism"" towards Brazil, for disallowing a goal scored by Colombian defender Mario Yepes and allowing too many fouls by the Brazilians to occur without punishment, leading the Colombians to play aggressively as well. There have been arguments that had Carballo properly controlled the game, fewer fouls (as well as Neymar's injury) may have occurred.

Despite the controversy, Colombia were awarded the FIFA World Cup Fair Play Trophy|FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the tournament.

===Brazil vs Netherlands===
In the second minute of the third-place play-off, Thiago Silva pulled down Arjen Robben as he ran into Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César's box with the ball for a clear goal-scoring opportunity. Under IFAB laws, Silva ought to have been shown a red card, but he was shown a yellow card instead by the Algerian referee Djamel Haimoudi. The referee called for a penalty, while the foul happened outside the box, which was eventually scored by Robin van Persie. The Netherlands' second goal in the 16th minute was later shown to be offside, which was ignored by the referees. Haimoudi had another controversial call in the 67th minute when he showed Brazilian midfielder Oscar a yellow card for diving, the only such instance in this tournament when replays showed that he was taken down in the box by opponent Daley Blind.

==Safety==
===Construction===

Stadium construction for the 2014 World Cup was plagued by accidents, cost overruns and delays, with eight workers dying in various accidents while building the World Cup's 12 arenas. In late October 2013, a fire during construction of the Arena Pantanal at Cuiabá in Mato Grosso state came 24 hours after the state governor warned the stadium might not be 100 percent complete in time for the deadline. Footage also emerged of fans climbing what appeared to be an unstable staircase made with scaffolding leading to the Maracanã Stadium, before the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group F#Argentina vs Bosnia and Herzegovina|Argentina–Bosnia and Herzegovina match.

===Breaches into stadiums===

At Chile's 2014 FIFA World Cup Group B#Spain vs Chile|Group B match against Spain on 18 June, about 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracanã Stadium forced their way in. They broke through security, after one fan pretended to be sick to distract the guard. They proceeded into the media centre, smashed the glass door, knocked over two partition walls and entered the stadium. Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the events, while others had reached the stands. Earlier, on 15 June, about 20 Argentinians made a similar breach during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Group F#Argentina vs Bosnia and Herzegovina|Argentina–Bosnia and Herzegovina match at the same stadium.

===Violence between England fans===
On 19 June during England's 2014 FIFA World Cup Group D#Uruguay vs England|match against Uruguay in São Paulo, an England football supporter was assaulted and had a piece of his ear bitten off by another England fan, Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police reported.

Completion for the line, which would connect Congonhas-São Paulo Airport to three other lines in the monorail network, was scheduled for the start of the tournament, but construction was delayed as it did not receive environmental approvals, and was expected to be completed by the second half of 2015.

===Bridge collapse===

On 3 July, an overpass under construction in Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured. One witness blamed the accelerated construction schedules and the ""incompetence"" of the authorities and businesses for the disaster.

===Head injuries===
During the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious. The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.

Second, in the final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.","[ 0.08740234  0.16113281 -0.53515625 ...  0.11230469  0.05541992

There was controversy over Germany's victory celebration, which included a parody of the Argentina Gaucho. This event was later termed as ""Gauchogate"".

As the national team arrived to the fan zone at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on 15 July 2014, six players, Roman Weidenfeller, Shkodran Mustafi, André Schürrle, Miroslav Klose, Mario Götze and Toni Kroos sang a victory song with the Chorus form|chorus of nursery rhyme it'' I know a cowboy, the cowboy is called Bill''.

When changing to the second Verse–chorus form|verse they took a more upright posture and sang, ""and that's how the Germans go, the Germans go like that"". Just a few hours later, the name ''Gauchogate''

Many German newspapers criticized the celebration in the press. Die Zeit ran an article with the title ""Embarrassing appearance at victory party"", Die Welt called it a ""crazy idea"", Die Tageszeitung called it ""disrespectful"", and Faz.net said the celebration was ""a gigantic own goal"". The critics ranged from appeasement, that it was only a harmless song being sung in the intoxication of joy, to the classification as a mockery of the World Cup final opponent by calling their people short and Germans ""superior"". The Argentine sports newspaper ''Olé (sports newspaper)|Olé'' described the scene as a real controversy. Sports journalist Víctor Hugo Morales, through Radio Continental in Buenos Aires, called the six players who danced, ""disgusting Nazis"".

German Football Association president Wolfgang Niersbach said the dance wasn't meant to be ""disrespectful"", also adding that it was instead a ""spontaneous expression of happiness"" from the players.
